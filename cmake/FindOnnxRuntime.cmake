# Find ONNX Runtime (https://onnxruntime.ai) — headers only.
#
# Drift does not link ONNX Runtime. It compiles against the headers with ORT_API_MANUAL_INIT and
# dlopens whichever runtime the user installed (src/engine/OrtRuntime.cpp), which is what lets the
# CPU / CUDA / WebGPU choice be an addon rather than a configure-time decision. So the library
# being absent here is not an error; only the headers have to exist.
#
# Set ONNXRUNTIME_ROOT to the install prefix if the headers are not on the default path (e.g. an
# extracted onnxruntime-linux-x64-*.tgz release).
#
# Defines:
#   OnnxRuntime_FOUND
#   OnnxRuntime_INCLUDE_DIRS
#   ONNXRUNTIME_RUNTIME_LIBS  (shared libs found beside the headers, for the dev-tree bundle)
# and an imported target onnxruntime::headers.
